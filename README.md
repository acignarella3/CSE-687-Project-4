# CSE-687-Project-4

This repository contains the submission for Project 4. It is a UWP (Universal Windows Platform) application built with C++ in Visual Studio (alternatively known as Visual C++).

This application runs the code and DLL available in the Project 3 v2 repository. When the application is run, it opens a window with a button labeled "Send Message". Clicking this button will trigger the code to run the tests as stored in the DLL. This is tracked via a string "logger" that is printed out on completion.
